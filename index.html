                <i>Issues and solutions to computer vision based image localisation (or relocalisation) through
					smart feature selection and other methologies to be used on small embedded systems and other projects
					under <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mbala/">Prof M. Balakrishnan</a> IIT Delhi. This is an ongoing project under the 
					tutelage of Research Associate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikas-upadhyay-0ba3628a/?originalSubdomain=in">Mr. Vikas Upadhyay</a>

				<b>Initial problem statement :</b>
				<br> We wanted to create a fast implementation for understanding where we are and which path we are to take in a known environment
				for the Assistech Lab at IITD. This could be done by first matching the image or path to one in our database and then triangulating to 
				the path that the person/robot wants to take.<br>
				Numerous Machine learning as well as Vision+Geometry based approaches are available to solve it. We intended to use a white box
				method that could be scalable in the longer run. ( i.e. without retraining our networks )
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The obvious choice :</b><br>
				All feature selection discussions must start with SIFT, It is a robust way to identify "good" feature points and match them between
				two images However the run time was too high, another viable option to then consider was Speeded Up Robust features(SURF).
				Not to reinvent the wheel here as long as the ulterior motive would suffice. <a href="http://www.cscjournals.org/library/manuscriptinfo.php?mc=IJIP-51">A comparison of SIFT, PCA-SIFT and SURF</a> 
				is a good paper to start with. I then used OPENCV <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_matcher/py_matcher.html" >docs</a> to make my own version of path identifier.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Approach I :	</b><br>
				Another hint to our solution was that we had a constant stream of images and we could use temporal information as well.
				SLAMing should work just as well for our final solution however similar problems of run time were to be corrected.
				ORB-SLAM was finalised for testing and improvements if possible. (However, <a href="./issues.html">running it was easier said than done)</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Approach II : </b><br>
				ORB-SLAM works on the ORB algorithm provided by OpenCV, We decided to use the intrinsic FAST corner 
				detection and thence create a cluster for the corner points, we then used generalised hough transform to match 
				the clusters in different images. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Approach III :</b><br>
				Another approach to relocalise was to have blob matching algorithms mark out interest areas or perhaps bounding boxes of 
				feature rich regions for identification, many of the SLAM algorithms avoid this but using bins of feature areas and then 
				putting an upper bound on the number of features detected in that, so the entire image can be mapped and not just a 
				small part, however mapping was not an aim here.
