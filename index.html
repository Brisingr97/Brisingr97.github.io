                <i>Issues and solutions to computer vision based image localisation (or relocalisation) through
					smart feature selection and other methologies to be used on small embedded systems and other projects
					under <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~mbala/">Prof M. Balakrishnan</a> IIT Delhi. This is an ongoing project under the 
					tutelage of Research Associte <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikas-upadhyay-0ba3628a/?originalSubdomain=in">Mr. Vikas Upadhyay</a>

				<b>Initial problem statement :</b>
				<br> We wanted to create a fast implementation for understanding where we are and which path we are to take in a known environment
				for the Assistech Lab at IITD. This could be done by first matching the image or path to one in our database and then triangulating to 
				the path that the person/robot wants to take.<br>
				Numerous Machine learning as well as Vision+Geometry based approaches are available to solve it. We intended to use latter as a feature rich
				and concentrated databases would could be scalable in the longer run. ( i.e. without retraining our networks )
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The obvious choice :</b><br>
				All feature selection discussions must start with SIFT, It is a robust way to identify "good" feature points and match them between
				two images However the run time was too high, another viable option to then consider was SURF or basic corner detection using
				FAST algorithm and use it with color histograms and intensity management but since we were working indoors intensity of light
				should not be a factor as most lighting would be artificial.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Change in approach I :	</b><br>
				Another hint to our solution was that we had a constant stream of images and we could use temporal information as well.
				SLAMing should work just as well for our final solution however similar problems of run time evaluation were needed.
				ORB-SLAM was finalised for testing and updation if possible. (However, <a href="./issues.html">running it is easier said than done)</a>
