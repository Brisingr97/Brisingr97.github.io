                <i>My experiments with trying to run ORB SLAM on a VM and then a RPi Zero M
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Enroute :</b><br> I cloned the ORB SLAM repository from <a href="https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM">here</a> and started cloning 
				into the required dependecies starting from ROS<br>
				However the first hiccup was that ORB SLAM (1) was tested 
				only on ROS which were compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 and I was running 16.04 on my VM.
			</p>
			<p>
				Onto Ubuntu 14.04 with ROS indigo! Hiwever there was another issue, the version of OpenCV was a mismatch, So a fresh installation
				of OpenCV (v2.4) was required, which surpringly took ~11 Gigs of space almost depeleting my puny 20GB VM harddrive.<br>

				New VM ,60Gigs HDD, Repeat<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				After all the version aligned and compling the code, There was an issue,<br><br>
				<i>" typedef Eigen::Map<Matrix<double, D, D>, Matrix<double,D,D>::Flags & AlignedBit ? Aligned : Unaligned >  HessianBlockType;"</i><br><br>
				Which meant that the version of my Eigen library was wrong.
				Their releases can be found <a href="https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/src/2524f6185981c6ec1782aeea7f3e2c56211cac13?at=3.1">here</a>					
			</p>

			<p>
				After spending almost 2 days on Stack-Overflow looking for specific compilation error, I learnt that because of such issues
				ORB SLAM was refreshed to <a href="https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2"> ORB SLAM 2.</a>
				Which <i>could</i> work on Ubuntu 16.04.<br>
				Back to old VM.<br>
				Downloaded <b>Pangolin</b><br> (installs like butter)
				Downloaded <b>Eigen</b>(please use 3.1 and not 3.2 otherwise you'll get the same problem)<br>
				ROS was not required.<br>
				I ran it on TUM and KITTI datasets and then moved the system to a more mobile version to test the efficiency.
